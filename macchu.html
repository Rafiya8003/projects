        It was built as a refuge for the elite of the Inca aristocracy (Inca’s family), the fortress was located on the eastern slopes of the Vilcanota mountain range, about 80 kilometers from Cusco, the capital of the empire.

			It is believed that Machu Picchu was a royal citadel or religious site sacred to the Incas, whose civilization was virtually wiped out by the Spanish invaders in the 16th century.
			 For hundreds of years, until American archaeologist Hiram Bingham encountered it in 1911, making it known to the world.

		<h2>FACTS</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="para-1">
		<ul>
			<li>Machu Picchu is one of the <strong>New Seven Wonders of the World</strong>.</li>
			<li>Amazingly, no wheels were used to transport heavy rocks for the construction of the city.</li>
			<li>Structures at Machu Picchu were built with a technique called <strong>&amp;ldquo ashlar.”</strong> Stones are cut to fit together without mortar. Remarkably, not even a piece of paper can fit in between two stones.</li>
			<li>The citadel has two parts: Hanan and Urin according with the Inca tradition.</li>
			<li>In the Quechua native language,<strong> “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”</strong></li>
			<li>Many of the stones that were used to build the city weighed more than 50 tons. How did these stones get up the mountain? Some were chiseled from the granite bedrock of the mountain ridge. For others, hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.</li>
			<li>On the Inca Trail, many porters sleep with a shiny metal object or mirror beneath them. They believe it sends away spirits coming up through the earth and whisks them away. Ask any guide or porter, and most will tell you that sometimes they have experienced the feeling of being pulled out of their tents by spirits of the past.</li>
